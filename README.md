- AI development workflow management

## Project Structure

The project maintains key documentation files for AI development:

- `productContext.md` - AI product strategy and use cases
- `activeContext.md` - Current AI development focus
- `systemPatterns.md` - AI architecture patterns
- `developmentWorkflow.md` - AI project standards
- `operationalContext.md` - AI system operations
- `projectBoundaries.md` - AI technical constraints
- `techContext.md` - AI technology stack
- `currentTasks.md` - AI development task tracking

## Usage
